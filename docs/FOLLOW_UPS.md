# Follow-ups

This file tracks non-blocking items deferred during reviews so they don’t get lost. Prefer filing GitHub Issues when available; this is a lightweight in-repo alternative.

## How to use

- Add a row when a review identifies a non-blocking improvement.
- Link back to the PR review section that raised it.
- Close the loop by marking the row done and referencing the PR/commit that fixed it.
